  bio: `I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Davis, investigating grapevine-virus interactions using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches. My research focuses on understanding the metabolic and transcriptional impacts of Grapevine Red Blotch Virus (GRBV) on grape quality and wine production.

My doctoral research at Banaras Hindu University focused on developing nano-encapsulated antifungal formulations against food-borne pathogens. I engineered chitosan-based delivery systems that significantly inhibited Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin contamination.

With a track record of 20+ peer-reviewed publications, I am passionate about translating fundamental research into practical solutions for sustainable agriculture and food safety.`,
