  bio: `I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of California, Davis, investigating grapevine-virus interactions using transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches, building on foundational GRBV research. I lead CDFA/USDA-funded projects on grapevine virus impacts.

My doctoral research at Banaras Hindu University focused on developing nano-encapsulated antifungal formulations against food-borne pathogens. I engineered chitosan-based delivery systems that significantly inhibited Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin contamination.

With a track record of 20+ publications, grant contributions, and mentorship experience, I am passionate about translating fundamental research into practical solutions for sustainable agriculture and food safety.`,
